# Big Dan’s Blog

Big Dan’s Blog is a full-stack web application built to publish and manage movie and television reviews. The site includes a public-facing blog for readers and a secure admin dashboard that allows the site owner to independently create, edit, pin, and delete posts.

This was the first complete website I ever built. All HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Firebase integration was self-taught and written entirely by me. I built this project both as a functional product for my friend Daniel and as a hands-on learning experience to better understand full-stack development concepts.
