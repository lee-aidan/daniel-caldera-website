# Big Dan’s Blog

Big Dan’s Blog is a full-stack web application built to publish and manage movie and television reviews. The site includes a public-facing blog for readers and a secure admin dashboard designed to give the site owner complete control over all content without requiring access to the source code. Through the admin page, the owner can create, edit, pin, and delete reviews, update site information, and manage what appears publicly on the site, all within a protected interface.

This was the first complete website I ever built. All HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Firebase integration was self-taught and written entirely by me. I built this project both as a functional product for my friend Daniel and as a hands-on learning experience to better understand full-stack development concepts and real-world application design.

I applied my informatics background when learning JavaScript to design the movie poster integration for the site. When creating or editing a review, the owner simply types in the name of a movie or show, and the site automatically fetches the corresponding poster and attaches it to the post. The logic was written to handle variations in titles and to fail gracefully if a result isn’t found, keeping the workflow simple and robust. This feature allowed me to translate familiar concepts—structured inputs, external data sources, and resilience to change—into a practical front-end implementation.
