# Big Dan’s Blog

Big Dan’s Blog is a full-stack web application built to publish and manage movie and television reviews. The site includes a public-facing blog for readers and a secure admin dashboard that allows the site owner to independently create, edit, pin, and delete posts.

This was the first complete website I ever built. All HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Firebase integration was self-taught and written entirely by me. I built this project both as a functional product for my friend Daniel and as a hands-on learning experience to better understand full-stack development concepts.

I applied my informatics background when learning JavaScript to design the movie poster integration for the site. When creating or editing a review, the admin simply types in the name of a movie or show, and the site automatically fetches the corresponding poster and attaches it to the post. The logic was written to handle variations in titles and to fail gracefully if a result isn’t found, keeping the workflow simple for the user. This feature allowed me to translate concepts I was familiar with (structured inputs, external data sources, and robustness to change) into a practical front-end implementation.
